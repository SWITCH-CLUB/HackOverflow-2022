## About Project
Most of the people face difficulty for finding places to settle when they travel to different cities due to transfer in their job or the students who get placements in different cities. Sometimes people donâ€™t have any connections in those cities so they find it difficult to get a room on rent.

## Use Cases of your project
We have found a perfect solution to the problem. We will be making an mobile application along with the web application that will serve this purpose.
We will be helping the persons who are in need of it and will be helping them in finding a suitable place to live on rent.
This will not only help those people who will be searching places to live on rent but also to those people who are letting their houses on rent.
