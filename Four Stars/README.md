## About Project-
We would prepare a system that will evaluate the problem complexity and filter it out, and sends it to the respective officer to deal with it. We will use python technolgy.ogy to solve this issue.
A database will be created which will allow the customer to insert his Own name, Account number, Phone number, Complaint Details, and in which department he wants to push his complaint.
In real life a customer will avail the facility to register his complaint without turing to bank physically.
