## About Project
A large section of the population suffering from skin problems do not avail medical treatment mostly because they cannot afford them or theyâ€™re unaware about it. Even dermatologists in many cases misdiagnose very common skin problems. We took up this project to find an efficient and cost effective solution to this problem with the help of AI. The project aims to use Image Classification to diagnose skin problems on the basis of its prevalence and severity.
